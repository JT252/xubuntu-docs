	<title>Getting to know your desktop environment</title>

	<para>When your computer has finished booting up, and after entering your login data, you will
		arrive at the Xubuntu desktop. It comes with many features designed to make your life easy, it is
		well worth taking the time to get to know it.</para>

	<section id="desktop">
		<title>Desktop</title>

		<para>The Xubuntu desktop has a single panel located at the top of the screen.</para>

		<section id="desktop-top-panel">
			<title>The Panel</title>

			<para>The panel is used for starting and switching applications and for receiving information about your system. On the left side of the panel you will see the Xubuntu logo, &appmenu;. Clicking on this icon will open the <guilabel>Menu</guilabel>, offering you many choices of applications to start. Along the bottom of the menu window are icons for &settings; <guilabel>Settings Manager</guilabel>, &lockscreen; <guilabel>Lock Screen</guilabel> and &logout; <guilabel>Log Out</guilabel>.</para>

			<para>The middle section of the panel is dedicated to window buttons for open applications. On the far right is the clock, displaying the date and time. To the left of that is the <guilabel>Notification Area</guilabel>. Here you will see indicators which give you information on your system, including network connectivity, sound volume level, battery status (when appropriate), instant messages and more. Some notification icons only appear when needed, for instance when software updates are available.</para>

			<para>The position of the panel, the items it contains and the <guilabel>Menu</guilabel> are all customizable. See <xref linkend="settings-preferences" /> for more information on those topics.</para>
		</section>
		
		<section id="desktop-desktop">
			<title>The Desktop</title>

			<para>The default desktop has just three icons on it: <guilabel>Home</guilabel>,
				<guilabel>File System</guilabel> and <guilabel>Trash</guilabel> (icons for removable
				devices will also appear when those devices are	present). You can customize your desktop by right-clicking in a blank area and choosing
				<menuchoice><guimenuitem>Desktop Settings</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. From here you can
				change the wallpaper and modify menu and icon behavior.</para>
		</section>
	</section>

	<section id="files-directories">
		<title>Files and directories</title>

		<para>Xubuntu comes with Xfce's file manager <application>Thunar</application>. For
			simplicity's sake, we will just refer to it as the File Manager. Load it from
			&file-manager; or by double-clicking the <guilabel>Home</guilabel> or <guilabel>File
			System</guilabel> icons on your desktop.</para>

		<section id="files-directories-navigation">
			<title>Navigation</title>

			<para>The File Manager's default view consists of a shortcut pane on the left side, the
				main area on the right, and a pathbar above the main area. The shortcut pane provides
				shortcuts to different folders on your system. The first shortcut under <guilabel>PLACES</guilabel> will lead to your home
				directory, the directory where you store all your personal data, and will have
				the name of the current user. That directory will probably appear empty. The
				<guilabel>File System</guilabel> shortcut under <guilabel>DEVICES</guilabel> will take you to the root of your filesystem.
				You may want to explore it a bit, even though it may be confusing to you if you are new
				to Linux. Just click on the different folders and see what's inside. When you're done,
				return to your home directory by clicking on the top shortcut.</para>

			<tip><para>You can add your own shortcuts by simply dragging folders to the shortcut pane.
				This will allow you to access important folders instantly!</para></tip>

			<tip><para>When using <application>Thunar</application> you will, in general, only have read rights to files you see while browsing under the <guilabel>File System</guilabel> shortcut.</para></tip>

			<para>The main area will always display the contents of the current folder. Double-click on
				folders to enter them, and right-click on files/folders to get a pop-up window offering
				you some choices of what to do with them. Select multiple files by dragging a rectangle
				over them with the mouse. Alternatively, select one file, hold down the <keycap>Shift</keycap>
				key, and increase/decrease the selection using the arrow keys.</para>

			<para>To easily see the path you took to get to the current directory, you can change the default View options. From the File Manager menu, select <menuchoice><guimenuitem>View</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>Location Selector</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>Pathbar Style</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. Now you can click on any pathbar icon to change to the directory it represents. Note that right-clicking on pathbar icons will also bring up a pop-up window with some options.</para>
		</section>

		<section id="files-directories-creating-deleting">
			<title>Creating and deleting files and folders</title>

			<para>To create a new document, right-click on some empty space in your home directory and
			select <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Create Document</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>Empty
			File</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the pop-up menu. The File Manager will prompt you for
			a name. Just go with the suggested name for now. After this, you will see the new file in
			your home directory. Right-click on it and choose
			<menuchoice><guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. This will show you some
			details about the file. Right-click on the file once more and choose
			<menuchoice><guimenuitem>Move to Trash</guimenuitem></menuchoice> to remove it. The file will be
			put into the Trash.</para>

			<tip><para>If you ever want to undo the deleting of a file, open <guilabel>Trash</guilabel>,
				right-click the file and click 
				<menuchoice><guimenuitem>Restore</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para></tip>

			<para>To create a new folder, right-click on the empty space, and choose
				<menuchoice><guimenuitem>Create Folder</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. You will be prompted
				for a name. Type something and hit <keycap>&key;Enter</keycap>. You will see this new folder
					in your home directory. Double-click on it to enter it. To rename or remove the
					folder, right-click on it and choose the appropriate option from the pop-up menu.</para>
		</section>

		<section id="files-directories-copying">
			<title>Copying</title>

			<para>To copy and move files on your computer, just click and drag files and folders to
				other folders.</para>
		</section>

		<section id="files-directories-removable-devices">
			<title>Removable devices</title>

			<para>When inserting CDs, USB sticks or other removable media into your computer, or
				inserting removable devices like a music player, Xubuntu should automatically detect
				the new device. For example, after inserting a CD into your optical drive, you will see
				a new shortcut in the left pane of the <application>File Manager</application>
				representing the CD. Clicking on it will open the CD in the main area, just like
				clicking on a regular folder. To remove the CD, right-click on the shortcut, and choose
				<menuchoice><guimenuitem>Eject</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. The same applies for
				any other removable media.</para>

			<note><para>Please note that pressing the eject button on your CD drive may not work. This
				may be surprising to some users, but it is in fact the expected behavior. Before the CD
				can be ejected, it needs to be properly "released" (unmounted) by the system. To remove
				a CD, always right-click on its shortcut and choose
				<menuchoice><guimenuitem>Eject</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para></note>

		<section id="files-directories-customizing-thunar">
			<title>Customizing Thunar</title>

			<para>There are many ways to customize the <application>File Manager</application>. If you do
				not like the way the icons are displayed, choose <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>View as	Detailed List</guimenuitem></menuchoice> to have the contents of
				the current directory displayed as a list.</para>

			<para>You can have the <application>File Manager</application> display a location bar
				instead of the pathbar by selecting <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Location Selector</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>Toolbar
				Style</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. If you prefer a tree view in the left pane, choose
				<menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Side Pane</guimenuitem>
				<guimenuitem>Tree</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para>

			<para>You can add Custom Actions, these can add useful options to the menu. Many custom actions can be found at the Ubuntu Wiki <ulink url="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ThunarCustomActions"> Thunar Custom Action </ulink> page</para>

			<para>For more choices, explore the options under <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para>
