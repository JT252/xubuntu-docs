	<title>Managing installed applications</title>

	<para>In Xubuntu, you don't need to download and install packages separately. Instead, you can use the software repositories to install new software. The applications and libraries are stored as packages in the repositories and they are added, removed and updated with package managers.</para>

	<para>Xubuntu comes with two package managers installed:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para><application>Ubuntu Software Center</application>, a simple graphical user interface to install new software.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para><application>apt-get</application>, a command-line tool that can be used for advanced package management. For more information <application>apt-get</application>, see the <ulink url="&debian-apt-manual;">Debian apt manual</ulink>.</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<note><para>You will need administrative access to add and remove software.</para></note>

	<caution><para>You can only use one package manager at a time. If you start another package manager while one is already open, you will receive an error message.</para></caution>

			<caution><para>Some applications depend on others being installed in order to work properly. If you try to remove an application which is needed by another application, both of them will be removed. You will be asked to confirm that this is what you want to happen before the applications are removed.</para></caution>

		<section id="software-repositories-more">
			<title>Enabling more repositories</title>

			<para>It is possible to add extra repositories, such as those provided by third parties or those for older version of Xubuntu. To enable more software repositories:</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>Open &software-properties; or &software-properties-usc; and go to the <guilabel>Other Software</guilabel> tab</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Press <guibutton>Add...</guibutton> to add a new repository.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Enter the APT line for the extra repository. This should be available from the website of the repository or similar and should look similar to the following: <literal>deb http://ftp.debian.org etch main</literal></para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Press <guibutton>Add Source</guibutton> and then click <guibutton>Close</guibutton> to save your changes.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>You will be notified that the information about available software is out-of-date. Press <guibutton>Reload</guibutton>.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Most software repositories use a GPG key to digitally sign the files they provide, which makes it easy to check that the files have not been tampered with since their creation. In order for apt to be able to check this, you need the public key that corresponds to the signatures. The key should be available for download on the repository's website. Once you have downloaded the GPG key, import the key by selecting the <guilabel>Authentication</guilabel> tab, clicking on <guibutton>Import Key File</guibutton>, and then selecting the GPG key to be imported.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

			<caution><para>Be careful when installing software from third-party repositories. It may not have been tested with Xubuntu and could cause your system to break.</para></caution>

		<section id="software-repositories-restricted">
			<title>Restricted and non-free software</title>

			<para>Most of the software available for Xubuntu is free, open-source software. This software is free for anyone to install and use, and people can modify the software and redistribute it if they like. Xubuntu is built from this type of software.</para>

			<para><guilabel>Non-free software</guilabel> is software that is not freely redistributable or modifiable. This makes it difficult for the Xubuntu developers to improve the software and correct problems, so it is normally recommended that you use <ulink url="&ubuntu-philosophy;">free software</ulink> instead.</para>

			<para><guilabel>Restricted software</guilabel> is software that has restrictions on its use, preventing it from being classed as free software. Non-free software is a type of restricted software, where the restrictions are due to the software having a non-free license. Other reasons for software being classed as restricted include legal issues (use of some types of software is illegal in some countries) and patent issues (some software requires a patent license to be used legally).</para>

			<para>In some cases, restricted software is the only option. Such cases include software for the playback of certain audio and video formats, some fonts and certain video card drivers.</para>

			<para>You should be warned by the package manager when you try to install restricted software. If the restricted software cannot be used legally in your country then there is little you can do; you should not install the software. If the software is restricted simply because it is non-free, you may choose to use it (for example, in the case of graphics card drivers). Be aware that most restricted software is not supported in Xubuntu and problems with such software often cannot be corrected by Xubuntu developers.</para>

			<warning><para>Sometimes it is difficult to determine why a particular software package is restricted. If this is the case, seek advice on the <ulink url="&ubuntu-forums;">Ubuntu Forums</ulink>. If you are still unable to determine why a package is restricted, err on the side of caution and do not install it; it may be illegal to use it in your country.</para></warning>

		</section>

		<section id="applications-offline-installation">
			<title>Helpful applications</title>

			<para><application>APTonCD</application> can be used to create a CD that contains all the packages you have on your system, or it can create CDs with packages or entire repositories of your choice. In a package manager, such as <application>Ubuntu Software Centre</application>, find the <application>APTonCD</application> package and install it. Further documentation on <application>APTonCD</application> can be found on the <ulink url="&aptoncd-web;">APTonCD website</ulink>.</para>

			<para>If you have access to a second computer which does have internet access, you can use it along with <application>apt-offline</application> to download the necessary package information from the internet and then transfer that data to the disconnected computer. This is a multi-step process. More information on the procedure can be found on the <ulink url="&communitywiki-installing;">Ubuntu Community Help wiki</ulink>.</para>

			<para><application>Keryx</application> is a portable, cross-platform package manager for APT-based (Ubuntu, Debian) systems.

	<section id="update-configuration">
		<title>Changing update frequency and behaviour</title>

		<para>You can change the frequency of the check and the way in which updates are handled. When <application>Software Updater</application> runs and presents you with its dialog, there is a <guilabel>Settings</guilabel> button at the bottom. Pressing this will open the <guilabel>Software Sources</guilabel> dialog at the <guilabel>Updates</guilabel> tab. Alternatively, you can access the settings dialog by going to &software-properties; and opening the <guilabel>Updates</guilabel> tab.</para>
		<para>The following settings can be changed from this dialog:</para>

		<section id="update-configuration-sources">
			<title>Update Sources</title>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Important security updates</guilabel> - Updates that fix critical security flaws are made available through this source. It is recommended that all users leave this source enabled (it should be enabled by default).</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Recommended updates</guilabel> - Updates that fix serious software problems (which are not security flaws) are made available through this source. Most users will want to leave this source enabled as common and annoying problems are often fixed with these updates.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

			<caution><para>The following updates should be used with some caution.</para></caution>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Pre-released updates</guilabel> - Updates that are currently being tested before being released to everyone are provided through this update source. If you would like to help test new updates (and get fixes for problems more quickly), enable this source. Be aware that these updates may not yet be well tested; it is not recommended that you enable this source unless you are prepared to experience occasional problems.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Unsupported updates</guilabel> - When new versions of popular software are released they are sometimes “backported” to an older version of Xubuntu so that users can benefit from new features and fixes for problems. These backports are unsupported, may cause problems when installed and should only be used by people who are in a real need of a new version of a software package that they know has been backported.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
