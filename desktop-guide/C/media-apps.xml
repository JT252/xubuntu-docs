			<title>Listening to music</title>

			<para>You can use <application>gmusicbrowser</application> and <application>Parole Media Player</application> to listen to music on your computer. <application>Parole Media Player</application> may open audio files when they are double-clicked, but <application>gmusicbrowser</application> is better at handling large music collections. By right clicking on a media file you can choose which application to use by default.</para> 
			
			<para>In order to play some popular audio formats like MP3, you will need to install some additional software. Unfortunately, this software cannot be provided by default in Xubuntu due to legal restrictions in some countries.</para>

			<caution><para>Read <xref linkend="software-repositories-restricted" /> before following the instructions below. There are some legal issues that you should be aware of.</para></caution>

			<para>To be able to play MP3 files in <application>gmusicbrowser</application>, install the <literal>&package;gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly</literal> package.</para>

			<para>Initially, <application>gmusicbrowser</application> will not automatically search for music files on your computer and you will have to manually direct <application>gmusicbrowser</application> to your music files by doing the following:</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>Open &gmusicbrowser;</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Open the menu (a gear at the top right) and click <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Settings</guimenuitem></menuchoice></para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>In the <guilabel>Settings</guilabel> dialog, go to the <guilabel>Library</guilabel> tab</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Click <guibutton>Add Folder</guibutton> and choose the directory that contains your music files and press <guibutton>OK</guibutton>; your selection will now appear in the <guilabel>Settings</guilabel> dialog</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>If you wish to add other locations of music files repeat the previous step, or otherwise, press <guibutton>Close</guibutton></para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><application>gmusicbrowser</application> will begin to scan your library. After the <guilabel>Scanning</guilabel> progress bar disappears, you may have to change views (to the left of the search) or restart <application>gmusicbrowser</application> to see your library.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

		<tip><para> When <application>gmusicbrowser</application> scans the library, consider changing <guilabel>Settings - Library - Check real length of mp3</guilabel> to <guilabel>When added</guilabel> to decrease the time the first scan takes on large music collections</para></tip>

		<section id="media-music-wrong-data">
			<title>I see wrong metadata (song names, covers) for my tracks in gmusicbrowser</title>

			<para>Some music player applications fetch cover art and other information about songs from the internet. However, <application>gmusicbrowser</application> only searches for cover art when you request. Simply right-click the album artwork, and select <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Search for a picture on internet</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. You can change the search query or service, but the defaults often work well. Select an image and save it to the album directory.</para>

			<para>When <application>gmusicbrowser</application> is not able to identify a particular song or album correctly, you can add the correct information manually by right-clicking the music file displayed in <application>gmusicbrowser</application>, selecting <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Song Properties</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and entering the appropriate information in the corresponding fields.</para>

			<para>If you prefer to search for the image yourself, find an album cover on the internet (or other sources) and save the image as <filename>cover.jpg</filename> in the album directory. Additionally, you can drag the cover art onto the cover art placeholder in <application>gmusicbrowser</application> or right-click and select <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Set Picture</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para>

		<section id="media-portable">
			<title>Portable music players</title>

			<para>Xubuntu will work with most portable audio players, including iPods. Normally, all you have to do is plug the player into your computer and then use <application>File Manager</application> to manually copy songs to and from the player.</para>

			<note><para>Newer iPods (6th generation and newer) will not work automatically with Xubuntu unless you have done an initial synchronization with <application>iTunes</application> first.</para></note>

			<para>If you have a portable music player which can also display photos and videos, you may prefer to use <application>Banshee</application>, which is a music player with good support for such devices.  iPod owners may also like to try specialized applications such as <application>GPixPod</application>, <application>gtkpod</application>, and <application>ideviceinstaller</application> for handling multimedia.</para>

		<section id="media-play-dvd">
			<title>Playing DVDs</title>

		<section id="media-play-video">
			<title>Playing video</title>

			<para><application>Parole Media Player</application> supports most video types. If you try to play an unsupported video file, <application>Parole Media Player</application> may notify you of a missing plugin. You can then install this plugin by following the wizard. Afterwards, you may need to restart <application>Parole Media Player</application>.</para>

			<para>If you are having difficulties getting a video to stream in your browser, <application>Parole Media Player</application> supports streaming most types of video.

			<section id="media-video-restricted">
				<title>Restricted formats</title>

				<para>Some video formats, such as Adobe Flash, QuickTime and Windows Media Video, are proprietary and so support for them cannot be included in Xubuntu by default. You must install some extra software to allow playback.</para>

				<para>In order to play the most common proprietary formats in <application>Parole Media Player</application> or <application>Firefox</application>, install the <literal>&package;xubuntu-restricted-extras</literal> package (see <xref linkend="software-repositories-restricted" /> for more information).</para>

		<title>Burning CDs and DVDs</title>

		<para>You can make your own CDs and DVDs by burning files onto a blank disc using the CD or DVD writer drive of your computer.</para>

		<para><application>Xfburn</application> is the default application in Xubuntu to complete these tasks. <application>Xfburn</application> allows you to to easily create audio CDs, burn CDs and DVDs with either plain data or disk images and prepare blank re-writable disks for a new burn.</para>

		<para>In order to launch <application>Xfburn</application>, go to &xfburn;.</para>

		<para>Once launched, you can insert a CD-R(W) or DVD-R(W) you wish to write to and then select the button corresponding to the action you wish to take (<guibutton>New Data Composition</guibutton>, <guibutton>Audio CD</guibutton>, etc.).</para>
