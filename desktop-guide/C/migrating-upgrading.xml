			<title>Windows applications on Linux</title>
			<para>It is possible to run Windows applications under Xubuntu. A few possible choices are:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para><ulink url="&wine-web;">Wine</ulink>, the Windows emulator. Wine allows running some Windows applications without having to install a Windows operating system. Refer to the <ulink url="&wine-appdb;">Wine AppDB</ulink> to find out which applications will run on Wine and the <ulink url="&wine-docs;">Wine documentation</ulink> for FAQ's and user support.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><ulink url="&vbox-web;">VirtualBox</ulink>, virtualization software. You can install a Windows operating system along with any application into a virtual machine managed by VirtualBox. Note that 3D support on VirtualBox is still quite unreliable. To read more about VirtualBox and virtualization, refer to the <ulink url="&vbox-docs;">VirtualBox end-user documentation</ulink>.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

			<tip><para>Both Wine and VirtualBox are available in the software repositories.</para></tip>

		<section id="windows-networking">
			<title>Windows networking on Linux</title>

			<para>Accessing Windows network shares under Xubuntu can be easily done using:</para>
			<itemizedlist>	
				<listitem><para>&file-manager;, with which you can browse publicly visible shares by clicking on the <guilabel>Network</guilabel> item in the sidebar. Alternatively, you can browse a remote file system by going to <menuchoice><guimenu>Go</guimenu><guimenuitem>Open Location...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and entering <userinput>smb://computername/sharename</userinput>.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>&gigolo;, which allows you to save bookmarks and manage remote file systems. To connect, click the first toolbar button. Select <guilabel>Windows Share</guilabel> from <guilabel>Service Type</guilabel>, then enter the remote share's details.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

			<para>If some options are not available or do not work, ensure that the <literal>&package;gvfs-backends</literal> is installed.</para>

		<title>Upgrading Xubuntu</title>

		<para>A new version of Xubuntu is released every 6 months, a new LTS version is released every 2 years; the Software Updater should inform you when a new version of its type (LTS or non-LTS) is available for download.</para>
		<para>For non-LTS versions there is only one way to upgrade from the previous version, LTS versions additionally offer an upgrade directly to the next LTS. For example a user of 14.10 can only upgrade to 15.04; a user of 14.04 could upgrade to 14.10 or 16.04.</para>
		<para>Currently non-LTS versions are supported for 9 months and LTS versions for 3 years.</para>
		<para>Upgrades usually take a while to complete. Typically, around 1000 megabytes of packages must be downloaded and installed, although the actual figure will depend on how many packages are already installed on your computer.</para>

		<section id="upgrading-to-next">
			<title>Upgrading to the next available release</title>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>Navigate to <application>Software Sources</application>, by clicking &wm-software-properties; and select the <guilabel>Updates</guilabel> tab</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Select <guilabel>For any new version</guilabel> from the list labeled <guilabel>Notify me of a new Ubuntu version</guilabel>, enter your password, and press <guibutton>Close</guibutton></para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Go to &wm-software-updater; and wait for the list of available updates to be downloaded</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>If a new version of Xubuntu is available, a box at the top of the window will appear saying that a new distribution release is available.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>To upgrade to the next available release that you can upgrade to, save all of your open documents and press the <guibutton>Upgrade</guibutton> button in &wm-software-updater;</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

			<note><para>If you are not getting an upgrade notification, or aren't seeing the release you are expecting to upgrade to, see <xref linkend="changing-upgrade-path"></xref>.</para></note>

		<section id="changing-upgrade-path">
			<title>Changing your upgrade path</title>

			<para>To change which releases you want to upgrade to, choose one of the following processes:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>Navigate to &software-properties-usc; and select the <guilabel>Updates</guilabel> tab. In the <guilabel>Updates</guilabel> tab, select either <guilabel>For any new version</guilabel> or <guilabel>For long-term support versions</guilabel> from the <guilabel>Notify me of a new Ubuntu version</guilabel> dropdown depending on your choice.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Open the &terminal; and run <userinput>sudoedit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades</userinput> and change the line starting with <literal>prompt=</literal> to <userinput>prompt=normal</userinput> (for all releases) or <userinput>prompt=lts</userinput> (for LTS releases) depending on your choice</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

			<note><para>If you are running a regular release that is not immediately followed by an LTS release, you should not change the upgrade target to LTS release.</para></note>
			<caution><para>Upgrading an LTS version to anything other than another LTS version will lose the long term support.</para></caution>

		<section id="upgrading-to-devel">
			<title>Upgrading to the development version</title>

			<warning><para>Development releases often suffer from package breakages and other problems. Only install a development release if you are prepared to attempt to fix these problems for yourself  or if you want to help the Xubuntu team by testing and giving feedback.</para></warning>
			<note><para>You will need to be running the latest regular version to be able to upgrade to the version currently under development.</para></note>
			<para>If you would like to install and test the latest development version of Xubuntu before it is released, run <userinput>pkexec update-manager -c -d</userinput> at the command line. This will allow you to upgrade to the current development release. Please consider <ulink url="http://xubuntu.org/contribute/qa">getting involved</ulink> with reporting usage of development versions and associated packages.</para>
